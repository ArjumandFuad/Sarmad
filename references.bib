@article{Hancock2007,
abstract = {On traditional tables, people frequently use the third dimension to pile, sort and store objects. However, while effective and informative for organization, this use of the third dimension does not usually extend far above the table. To enrich interaction with digital tables, we present the concept of shallow-depth 3D - 3D interaction with limited depth. Within this shallow-depth 3D environment several common interaction methods need to be reconsidered. Starting from any of one, two and three touch points, we present interaction techniques that provide control of all types of 3D rotation coupled with translation (6DOF) on a direct-touch tabletop display. The different techniques exemplify a wide range of interaction possibilities: from the one-touch technique, which is designed to be simple and natural, but inherits a degree of imprecision from its simplicity; through to three-touch interaction, which allows precise bimanual simultaneous control of multiple degrees of freedom, but at the cost of simplicity. To understand how these techniques support interaction in shallow-depth 3D, we present a user study that examines the efficiency of, and preferences for, the techniques developed. Results show that users are fastest and most accurate when using the three-touch technique and that their preferences were also strongly in favour of the expressive power available from three-touch.

However, users of a tabletop system do not share a common perspective for the display of information: what is presented right-side-up to one participant is upside-down for another. In this paper, we survey five different rotation and translation techniques for objects displayed on a direct-touch digital tabletop display. We analyze their suitability for interactive tabletops in light of their respective input and output degrees of freedom, as well as the precision and completeness provided by each. We describe various tradeoffs that arise when considering which, when and where each of these techniques might be most useful. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new command selection method that provides an alternative to pull-down menus in pen-based mobile interfaces. Its primary advantage is the ability forusers to directly select commands from a very large set without the need to traverse menu hierarchies. The proposed method maps the character strings representing the commands onto continuous pen-traces on a stylus keyboard. The user enters a command by stroking part of its character string. We call this method "command strokes." We present the results of three experiments assessing the usefulness of the technique. The first experiment shows that command strokes are 1.6 times faster than the de-facto standard pull-down menus and that users find command strokes more fun to use. The second and third experiments investigate the effect of displaying a visual preview of the currently recognized command while the user is still articulating the command stroke. These experiments show that visual preview does not slow users down and leads to significantly lower error rates and shorter gestures when users enter new unpracticed commands. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in cybersecurity is the provision of an automated and effective cyber-threats detection technique. In this paper, we present an AI technique for cyber-threats detection, based on artificial neural networks. The proposed technique converts multitude of collected security events to individual event profiles and use a deep learning-based detection method for enhanced cyber-threat detection. For this work, we developed an AI-SIEM system based on a combination of event profiling for data preprocessing and different artificial neural network methods, including FCNN, CNN, and LSTM. The system focuses on discriminating between true positive and false positive alerts, thus helping security analysts to rapidly respond to cyber threats. All experiments in this study are performed by authors using two benchmark datasets (NSLKDD and CICIDS2017) and two datasets collected in the real world. To evaluate the performance comparison with existing methods, we conducted experiments using the five conventional machine-learning methods (SVM, k-NN, RF, NB, and DT). Consequently, the experimental results of this study ensure that our proposed methods are capable of being employed as learning-based models for network intrusion-detection, and show that although it is employed in the real world, the performance outperforms the conventional machine-learning methods.},

abstract = {Automated vehicles are a revolutionary step in mobility, providing a safe and convenient riding experience while keeping the human-driving task minimal to none. Therefore, these intelligent vehicles are equipped with sophisticated perception sensors (e.g., cameras and radars), high-performance computers, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven algorithms, and connectivity with other internet-of-things (IoT) devices. This makes autonomous vehicles (AVs) a special kind of cyber-physical system (CPS) that is moving at speed in highly interactive and dynamic environments (e.g., public roads). Thus, AV is a potential target for cyber attackers to weaponize, compromising safety and mobility on the road. The first step in addressing this problem is to have a robust threat modeling framework that can address the evolving cyber-physical threats, especially to AV applications. In this regard, two areas are studied in this paper: the common practice of threat modeling in automotive and the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, and sensors and machine learning (ML) algorithms for AV perception systems and potential cyber-physical attacks. A comparative threat analysis for an AV perception system with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard and a system-theoretic process analysis for security (STPA-Sec) approach is also demonstrated in this paper. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes a robust threat analysis and risk assessment framework with mathematical modeling to identify cyber-physical threats to AV perception systems that are critical for the driving behaviors and complex interactions of AVs in their operational design domain.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of complex technological infrastructures and services coupled with the continuously evolving threat landscape poses new sophisticated security risks. These risks are mostly associated with many diverse vulnerabilities related to software or hardware security flaws, misconfigurations and operational weaknesses. In this scenario, a timely assessment and mitigation of the security risks affecting technological environments are of paramount importance. To cope with these compelling issues, we propose an AI-assisted methodological framework aimed at evaluating whether the target environment is vulnerable or safe. The framework is based on the combined application of graph-based and machine learning techniques. More precisely, the components of the target together with their vulnerabilities are represented by graphs whose analysis identifies the attack paths associated with potential security threats. Machine learning techniques classify these paths and provide the security assessment of the target. The experimental evaluation of the proposed framework was performed on 220 artificially generated Active Directory environments, half of which injected with vulnerabilities. The results of the classification process were generally good. For example, the F1-score obtained by the Random Forest classifier for the assessment of vulnerable networks was equal to 0.91. These results suggest that our approach could be applied for automating the security assessment procedures of complex networked environments.},

abstract = {We investigated 12 years DNS query logs of our campus network and identified phenomena of malicious botnet domain generation algorithm (DGA) traffic. DGA-based botnets are difficult to detect using cyber threat intelligence (CTI) systems based on blocklists. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based CTI systems are required. This study (1) proposed a model to detect DGA-based traffic based on statistical features with datasets comprising 55 DGA families, (2) discussed how CTI can be expanded with computable CTI paradigm, and (3) described how to improve the explainability of the model outputs by blending explainable AI (XAI) and open-source intelligence (OSINT) for trust problems, an antidote for skepticism to the shared models and preventing automation bias. We define the XAI-OSINT blending as aggregations of OSINT for AI/ML model outcome validation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our models (96.3{\%} accuracy). Our random forest model provides better robustness against three state-of-the-art DGA adversarial attacks (CharBot, DeepDGA, MaskDGA) compared with character-based deep learning models (Endgame, CMU, NYU, MIT). We demonstrate the sharing mechanism and confirm that the XAI-OSINT blending improves trust for CTI sharing as evidence to validate our proposed computable CTI paradigm to assist security analysts in security operations centers using an automated, explainable OSINT approach (for second opinion). Therefore, the computable CTI reduces manual intervention in critical cybersecurity decision-making.},
